We are tasked with finding an infinite number of sets such that the 
intersection of any two sets is non-empty, but the intersection of any three
sets is empty.  Finding a truly infinite number of such sets would require
that each set be infinitely large.  Having noted that pedantic detail, we can,
indeed, put together an arbitrarily large collection of sets meeting the given
criteria.

We will demonstrate a base case of three sets, and will show inductively, given
a collection of N sets meeting the criteria, how to construct a collection of
N+1 sets.

First, we make the observation that any element must appear in no more than two
sets.  And, each set in a collection of N sets should contain N-1 elements.
(That yields exactly one element to have in common with each of the other N-1
sets.)  So, with N sets, each containing N-1 elements, each element appearing in
exactly two sets, there are thus N * (N-1) / 2 distinct elements used to
populate the sets.

For N = 3, and using whole numbers as elements, we can trivially create the sets:
{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}

Now, given N sets, we can easily add one additional element to each, and create
one new additional set, such that we end up with N+1 sets.  Let x be the largest
element appearing in the N sets.  Then, to our first set, we add the element x+1,
to the second we add x+2, and so on.  We then create a new set consisting of
{x+1, x+2, ... , x+N}  This new set maintains the property of having at least (in
fact, exactly) one element in common with each other set.  And, since the common
element is unique for each of the first N sets, there still remain no three sets
with a non-empty intersection.

We can continue this process repeatedly to construct an arbitrarily large
collection of sets meeting the initial given criteria.

As a final example, consider these six sets, formed using the described method.
{ 0, 1, 3, 6,10,15}
{ 0, 2, 4, 7,11,16}
{ 1, 2, 5, 8,12,17}
{ 3, 4, 5, 9,13,18}
{ 6, 7, 8, 9,14,19}
{10,11,12,13,14,20}
{15,16,17,18,19,20}
